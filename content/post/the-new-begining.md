This is my attempt to restart. This is my 4th attempt to blog. I started
blogging years ago. But something or the other always kept me from writing
regularly.

Sometimes I was just lazy to write. But most of the times, I digressed into
updating my core, plugins, themes, etc. After all I am a programmer, and I get
more satisfaction in creating (read breaking) and fixing stuff.

I don't have any particular agenda for this site. Just get scraps of information
from all over the internet and put it in a way that I , and possibly others, can
understand.

I will migrate date from my old site (someday).
