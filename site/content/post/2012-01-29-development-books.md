Here&#8217;s a list of books that I came across while doing some searching:

>   * [Analysis Patterns][1]:  A great book about designing large applications
>   * [Domain Driven Design][2]: Another great book about application design
>   * [Pragmatic Programmer][3]: The best way to not do stupid development
>   * [SICP][4] (free download): Learn about the structure of programming
>   * [Refactoring][5]: I didn’t learn anything new in this book but wrote code completely differently when I was done.
>   * Everything [Jay Fields][6] has written on testing:  I disagree with almost everything he says but it’s made me a much better programmer.  He tended to write from the position of a great developer on a struggling team.
> 
> I also recommend reading some design books, but the only good one I’ve read recently is [The Design of Everyday Things][7].
