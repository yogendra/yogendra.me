After many many years of open source advocacy, I have finally created my own first open source project. I have really started small. Too small actually.

**So whats this all about?**

This application is a simple launcher for Netbeans. I have no prior experience in Mac OS X application development. This is not even a full blown application, per say. Its just an Automator workflow.

**Where is it?**
