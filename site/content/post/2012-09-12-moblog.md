I have been thinking about blogging regularly, but with amout of work, home chores and everything in between, idea just gets lost. Then again veing lazy me us not easy.

Anyway if I can write quick posts from phone, may be it might just work. It could be as short as a Tweet or G+ update.
  
If I can get a decent 1 entry per week, I would be happy though.

I read a lot about programming, mobile platforms, etc., so I can comment about those here. I have no monetization objective behind this at the moment and don&#8217;t have any plan in long term future.
