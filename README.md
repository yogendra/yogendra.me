## FAQ

### Why GIT and HEXO

To get feedback. I want feedback on my work, posts, etc. And I want to provide a
simple/well-known way for everyone to do so.

### Why not use Blogger

I like Blogger. Its great. Frill free. But I want to be able to play around with
with javascript libraries (Just for fun!).

### Why not use WP/Drupal

Simple stack (only need webserver) and easy maintenance. I have used WP/Drupal
and they are great. Keeping up with version (core/plugin/theme) can be time
consuming. And they have a bit of learning curve. I have limited time.
