Today we are seeing an increasing number of enterprises opting to transform themselves into a "software driven business". They are recognizing software and software based services as a unique differentiator.

This has created a huge demand for cloud based or cloud-alike operating model within the organization. We are regularly find ourself talking to large traditional organizations, about internet-scale or web-scale operting model. They all want to build and deliver software like the Netflix, Uber, Lyft or Airbnb. This is an amazing time to be in the digital transformation space. It is almost a revolutionary change in progress. And I find myself on the front-row seat for this show.

Digital transaformation is a bery huge topic and deserves a conference of its own. Today I will talks about a very small part of this journey - selecting a runtime environment. It may seem like a no-brainer to an individual, but it is a very very important decision that an organization takes which influences each and every business and technical decision moving forward. Imagine as an individual developer you chose to build an application in scala. Six months later Kotlin has become more popular and is far more apealing to use in your project. May be your applcation is not large just a few hundred lines of code, so you decide to migrate to Kotlin. May be you spend good week to fully migrate the whole application.

Now imagine there are 100s of apps and you have to do the same. And changing the runtime also needs ensuring right libraries, drivers or SDK for dependent services. It gets very messy, very fast.

In large enterprises, migration is not a result of an individuals preference but driven by variety of economic factors, regulatory changes or market forces. You may start with building and running your application on public cloud, but as you grow your userbase and

In large enterprises, migration is not a result of an individuals preference but driven by variety of economic factors, regulatory changes and/or market forces. You may start with building and running your application on public cloud, but as you grow your service offerings you may be required to have keep data on-prem/onshore.
